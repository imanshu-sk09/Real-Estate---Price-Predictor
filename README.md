# Real-Estate---Price-Predictor
Hi I am Himanshu Sonkar. This is my Real Estate - Price Predictor(ML Project).


This machine learning project using python is created to give you a complete understanding on how machine learning problems are tackled in real world scenarios. Use the Jupyter notebook.

We will understand the problem of a real estate company from its CEO and then apply ML to solve it.  

In this project I am using python, analyzing the problem from collecting data, importing it to a Jupyter notebook, looking for promising attributes, finding out correlations, plotting graphs, creating a pipeline, dealing with missing values. 

At the end we present the problem to the real estates company who will use the model for predicting house prices given a set of features. I am using cross validation, train-test splitting, stratified shuffle split, cross validation and sampling work in action.
