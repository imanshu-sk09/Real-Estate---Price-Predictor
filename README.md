# Real-Estate---Price-Predictor
üõü Hi I am Himanshu Sonkar. This is my Real Estate - Price Predictor(ML Project).


üè∞ This machine learning project using python is created to give you a complete understanding on how machine learning problems are tackled in real world scenarios. Use the Jupyter notebook.

üè∞ We will understand the problem of a real estate, and how to automatically train software to predict the Price of house. some of the paramerter of house is given below:

‚õ±Ô∏èAttribute Information:

    1. CRIM      per capita crime rate by town
    2. ZN        proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 
                 25,000 sq.ft.
    3. INDUS     proportion of non-retail business acres per town
    4. CHAS      Charles River dummy variable (= 1 if tract bounds 
                 river; 0 otherwise)
    5. NOX       nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million)
    6. RM        average number of rooms per dwelling
    7. AGE       proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940
    8. DIS       weighted distances to five Boston employment centres
    9. RAD       index of accessibility to radial highways
    10. TAX      full-value property-tax rate per $10,000
    11. PTRATIO  pupil-teacher ratio by town
    12. B        1000(Bk - 0.63)^2 where Bk is the proportion of blacks 
                 by town
    13. LSTAT    % lower status of the population
    14. MEDV     Median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000's


üè∞ In this project I am using python, analyzing the problem from collecting data, importing it to a Jupyter notebook, looking for promising attributes, finding out correlations, plotting graphs, creating a pipeline, dealing with missing values. 

üè∞ At the end we present the problem to the real estates company who will use the model for predicting house prices given a set of features. I am using cross validation, train-test splitting, stratified shuffle split, cross validation and sampling work in action.
